#### Diagrams

**System Architecture:**

![Architecture Diagram](architecture.png)
*The RedAlert system is a client-side web application designed for privacy-focused relationship assessments using a modern frontend stack of Next.js 16 and React. The architecture follows a secure data flow where user responses to a 12-question evaluation are captured through a "Feminine/Masculine" themed interface and stored exclusively in the browser's Session Storage. By avoiding backend server interaction, the system ensures complete user anonymity. Upon completion, a dedicated assessment engine maps these raw answers to a numerical scale to calculate a Severity Index**, which is then dynamically rendered into interactive donut and bar charts using the Recharts library to provide immediate, visual feedback on relationship health.

**Application Workflow:**

![Workflow](workflow.png)
*Empowering your safety through data, RedAlert transforms personal reflections into a private, visual dashboard of your relationship health. Using a secure, client-side workflow, it analyzes patterns of respect and control to provide immediate clarity and essential emergency resources when you need them most.*
