# RedAlert — static assessment

Files:
- index.html — main single-page site
- styles.css — styling (light + dark support)
- script.js — minimal interactions

To view locally:

1. Open `redalert/index.html` in your browser directly.
2. OR serve on a local HTTP server (recommended):

```bash
cd redalert
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

This is a client-only static page; submitting the form just shows an alert.
